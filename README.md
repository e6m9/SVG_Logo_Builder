## Usage
In lieu of paying a graphic artist for a logo, one can generate a very rudimentary representation of a logo by typing 'node index.js' into the command line and answering a few prompts. You can see your 'logo' when you open the logo.svg file, that has been created in the logos folder, in a browser. Each time you run the application, a new image will ge generated without overwriting the previous one.

## Final Thoughts
As an artist, I think it is very important to pay artists when possible. I find the rudimentary images this application produces to be subpar interpretations of what a logo should be. However, as a small business owneer, I also understand how hard it is to make a mark as a lone creator or a freelancer and that sometimes it isn't feasible to pay an artist. It is my wish that anyone who uses an application like this reaches out as soon as they can afford it to a graphic designer as soon as they can afford to so that they can help another struggling freelancer and also get the kind of logo they deserve.
